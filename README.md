# Congressional App Challenge Submission

Our submisison for the 2018 Congressional App Challenge. We designed an app targetted at young voters. The app gives information on candidates, where to vote, and how to register to vote. The app was programmed for Android and developed in Android Studio, with Java and XML. Our submission won for our district, MA-9, and we were able to go to Washington D.C. to present the app.
